# Arcology Concurrent Programming Patterns

## Key Concepts
- U256Cumulative: Conflict-free counters for concurrent operations
- Bool arrays: Thread-safe boolean state management
- Concurrent-safe data structures

## Implementation Strategy
1. Replace regular mappings with concurrent data structures
2. Use U256Cumulative for order tracking
3. Implement conflict-free operations
